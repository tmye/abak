# PROJECT ARCHITECTURE


- create the mvp architecture for all the activities of the project.

- create a general persistent mode

- create common views and functions and utils, but when it comes to the architecture of the project,
    i need to do it all mvp.



All fragments and activities must implement the fragmentContracts/Views then, we will
know how to put order in the whole application.

Rest, drink something nice, sleep enough, watch a movie, and continue with it at home.
